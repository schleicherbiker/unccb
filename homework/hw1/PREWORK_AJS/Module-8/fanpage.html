    <h1>Linkin Park Fan Page</h1>
    <p>Linkin Park is an awesome band and they have a lot of good music. Everybody should listen to them because they're awesome, even though some of their more recent stuff is poppy. Their music blends pop, rap, and rock with an avant garde sound and eclectic style. </p>

    <h2>The core group consists of:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chester Bennington</li>
        <li>Mike Shinoda</li>
        <li>Joe Hahn</li>
        <li>Brad Delson</li>
        <li>Rob Bourdon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>One of my favorite albums is Hybrid Theory. The album art is awesome!</h2>
